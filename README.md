# Bold and Italics

## Bold

To put text in bold, use two asterisks: **This is a bold text**

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\

## Italicise

just use a single asterisk or underscore: *this is italicised*
_This is italicised_

## combination of both

you can combine both **bold** and *italics* by using combination of underscores and asterisk:_**This text is italicised and bold**_
